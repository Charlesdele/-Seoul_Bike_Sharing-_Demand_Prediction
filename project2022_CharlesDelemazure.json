It is important to make the rental bike\navailable and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens\nthe waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of\nrental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the\nprediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of\nrental bikes.\n\nThe dataset contains weather information (Temperature, Humidity,\nWindspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall),\nthe number of bikes rented per hour and date information.\n\nRelevant Papers / Citation Request\n\n[1] Sathishkumar V E, Jangwoo Park, and Yongyun Cho.

It also reduces\nair pollution by reducing the number of cars on the road. The bike\nsharing system is a new generation of traditional bike rental systems,\nand the entire process has been automated. Users can borrow bicycles for\nfree or for a fee and return them to another place.\n\nThe hypothesis in the research is that the bike sharing is highly\nrelated with the time of the day, season, and weather conditions. The\nresearch will try to predict the bike shares in the future. We are going\nto try to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared\nbikes depends.\n\nThis dataset contains the hourly and daily count of rental bikes between\nin 2017-2018 in in Seoul with the corresponding weather and seasonal\ninformation.\n\nImport the Data Set\n\n    path_data ": null, "\n    plt.title(\"Correlation with Rented Bike Count\",fontsize": null, "\n    sns.histplot(data": null, "\n    plt.tight_layout()\n\n[]\n\n    fig, axs ": null, "\n\n[]\n\nEncoding variables\n\nMachine learning algorithms and deep learning neural networks require\nthat input and output variables are numbers.This means that categorical\ndata must be encoded to numbers before we can use it to fit and evaluate\na model.\n\n    df ": null, "\n    for index,value in enumerate(df[\"Holiday\"].value_counts()):\n        plt.text(index, value, f\"% {value/perc:.3} - {value}\", ha": null, "\n    for index,value in enumerate(df[\"Functioning Day\"].value_counts()):\n        plt.text(index, value, f\"% {value/perc:.3} - {value}\", ha": null}
